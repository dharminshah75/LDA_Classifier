# LDA_Classifier
A classifier based on Linear Discriminant Analyzer

Most of the LDA algorithms found on github are just dimensionality reduction algorithm
This is a classifier algorithm.

Dataset link - http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Statlog+(Landsat+Satellite)

Files to be downloaded:-
  1. sat.trn
  2. sat.tst
  3. LDA_classification.py
  4. LDA_documentation.py

Steps to run the algorithm code on the satellite dataset.
1. Download all the above files uploaded on the Google Classroom into a
   single folder.
2. Create a folder named “data” in the new folder you just created above.
3. Move the “sat.trn” and “sat.tst” files downloaded in Step 1 into the “data”
   folder created in Step 2.
4. Open command prompt.
5. Navigate to the folder you created in Step 1.
6. Run the code by typing ‘python LDA_classification.py’
7. The code will take care of rest of the things :)
